# AmpliconArchitect
AmpliconArchitect (AA) is a tool to identify one or more connected genomic regions which have simultaneous copy number amplification and elucidates the architecture of the amplicon.   In the current version, AA takes as input next generation sequencing reads (paired-end Illumina reads) mapped to the hg19/GrCH37 reference sequence and one or more regions of interest.
